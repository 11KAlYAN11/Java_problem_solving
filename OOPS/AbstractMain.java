// Abstract class providing Structure (Common properties & methods)
// Same structure means in each class the method for startEngine() is must irrespective of implementation.
/* Structural Inheritance (Abstract Class)
ðŸ”¹ Use an abstract class when you want to provide a common structure (fields + methods) for all subclasses.
ðŸ”¹ It allows defining some common behavior while forcing subclasses to implement specific methods.
ðŸ”¹ abstract methods must be implemented by subclasses, while concrete methods provide a default implementation.
