         * 1️⃣ Exception
         * Definition: An Exception is a condition that can be caught and handled in the program.
         * When it occurs: Due to programming errors or external conditions (e.g., invalid input, file not found, division by zero).
         * How to handle: Using try-catch blocks or declaring with throws.
         * Types of Exceptions:
         * - Checked Exception: Must be handled (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
         * - Unchecked Exception: Occurs at runtime, can be avoided by fixing logic (e.g., NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException).

         * 2️⃣ Error
         * Definition: An Error is a serious problem that CANNOT be handled in the program.
         * When it occurs: Due to system-level issues (e.g., memory overflow, infinite recursion, JVM crashes).
         * How to handle: Generally, cannot be handled using try-catch. The only option is to fix the root cause.
         * Examples of Errors:
         * - OutOfMemoryError: When JVM runs out of memory.
         * - StackOverflowError: Due to infinite recursion.
         * - NoClassDefFoundError: If a required class is missing at runtime.
