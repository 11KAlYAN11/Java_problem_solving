     * Why Do Unchecked Exceptions Not Require throws in Method Declaration?
     Unlike checked exceptions, unchecked exceptions (RuntimeExceptions) do not require the throws declaration in the method signature because:

     âœ… 1. Compiler Does Not Enforce Handling
     Unchecked exceptions (like NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException) are caused by programming logic errors.
     The compiler does not check if the exception is handled using try-catch or declared with throws.
     Developers are expected to fix these errors in the code rather than force handling.
