    ✅ PART 2 — “If you don’t know where to start, start with HashMap” — valid?
        YES — 100% VALID ADVICE ✅

        But here’s the correct reasoning:

        When you’re stuck, ask:

        “Can I rephrase this problem as counting something so far?”

        If yes → HashMap / Prefix Sum


        👉 ~80–90% of array/string problems are solvable using some COMBINATION of:

            Two Pointer

            Sliding Window

            Hashing

            Prefix Sum

            ⚠️ Prefix Sum is NOT separate —
            it usually works WITH HashMap or Sliding Window.
